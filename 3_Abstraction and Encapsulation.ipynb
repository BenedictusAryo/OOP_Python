    "# 3. Abstraction and Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. Its main goal is to **`handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user.`** That enables the user to implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity. [Source](https://stackify.com/oop-concept-abstraction/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is the **`process of hiding implementation details from the user.`** Encapsulation is used to restrict access to methods and variables. In encapsulation, code and data are wrapped together within a single unit from being modified by accident.\n",
